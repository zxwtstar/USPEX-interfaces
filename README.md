# USPEX-interfaces
Some part of USPEX source code is published here to help users 
1) Interface their codes with USPEX, or debug the previous interfaces. This allows users to perform USPEX calculations by codes of their own choice.
2) Add new fitness functions to USPEX. This will allow users to search for best crystal structures for properties that are not included in USPEX yet.
